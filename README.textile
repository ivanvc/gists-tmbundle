h1. TextMate Bundle to create Public/Private Gists

With this bundle you can simply create public and private gists. You need to have Ruby, and configured your GitHub username and token in your global config. The URL will be copied to the clipboard.

h2. Pre-requisites

* Install ruby
* Configure your "GitHub account":https://github.com/account
* If for some reason your git binary is in a place that /usr/bin/env cannot locate, then you can set it to a TextMate Shell variable (`TM_GIT`), or add the path its in to `PATH`. For example, if you installed git from MacPorts, you would add `/opt/local/bin:` to the front of `PATH`,
* add your github username and token to your git config:
<pre>
<code>
  $ git config --global github.user [your username]
  $ git config --global github.token [your token]
</code>
</pre>
**or** to your shell environment:
<pre>
<code>
  export GITHUB_USER="[your username]"
  export GITHUB_TOKEN="[your token]"
</code>
</pre>

h2. Install
<pre>
<code>
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/ivanvc/gists-tmbundle.git Gists.tmbundle
osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'
</code>
</pre>
h2. That's it

* Use ⌘⌥⇧I to create a private gist
* Use ⌘⌥⇧U to create a public gist
